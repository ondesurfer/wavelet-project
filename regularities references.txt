For the second, the third and the fourth Daubechies-Wavelets
the critical Hoelder-exponents are from I. Daubechies and
J.C. Lagarias, 1992, "Two-scale Difference Equations II. Local
Regularity, Infinite Products Of Matrices And Fractals", p. 1068
For the first and the 5.-10. Daubechies-Wavelets see
I.Daubechies, 1992, "Ten Lectures On Wavelets", p. 232

The Sobolev-regularity is taken from the paper
"How Smooth Is Your Wavelet?" from M. Pollicott and H. Weiss,
